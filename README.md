## Hydrology of the Mekong Basin 
Current climate change estimates indicate that major environmental changes are likely to occur due to climate change in practically every part of the world, with majority of these changes being felt through modiﬁcation of hydrological cycle as e.g. ﬂoods, droughts and storms. Climate change impacts are also estimated to be particularly severe in many developing countries of the world.
